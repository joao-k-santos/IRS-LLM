# IRS-LLM
IRS LLM is a project for a real-time Intrusion Response System using Machine Learning and Large Language Models. It uses Deep Learning models to classify network logs in the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) and LLM models to dynamically create mitigation rules that are applied by the Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIDPS).
